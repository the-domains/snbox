  We love tower defense games, as I'm sure a lot of people do. Sketcher-D is an
  odd (but strangely satisfying) combination of tower defense, guitar hero and
  an endless shooter. You play from 1st person view as endless geometric
  monsters approach. Your only defense is to tap chevrons of corresponding
  colours (blue kills blue, red kills red, etc.)
